# CE-888-Assignment-2
**Three Datasets of Hate, Offensive and Sentiments are used in the assignment.**
One SVC model is trained for all three datasets.
**Datasets used are uploaded in the Github repository, CE-888 Assignment-2.**
Each dataset contains train and test text data alongwith labels text.
**To run the SVC model for each dataset, Train and Test texts alongwith labels texts are required to be uploaded to the Colab file.**
After uploading all the test and train text alongwith label texts, the code will run all the cells and accuracy result will be displayed for default values initially. Subsequently, the best estimated values of hyper parameters are picked up from grid search cross validation and accuracy is displayed as per the estimated best values of hyper parameters.
